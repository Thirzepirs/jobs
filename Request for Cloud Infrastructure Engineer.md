Request For Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
```
<pre><code>
At [Nerdalize](http://www.nerdalize.com) we're building an affordable, easy,
and transparent cloud for large HTC workloads, by [placing servers in people's homes](https://vimeo.com/122893200). Say wuuut?!
Yep, really. This way homeowners heat their house for free with our excess heat
and our compute customer gets the [best price/performance](http://www.nerdalize.com/cloud/).
We think this is pretty neat.

Do you know your stuff when it comes to networking, managing bare metal,
distributed storage, OS/network security and cluster ops? Then you’re our type!

If you also consider "Linus" or "RMS" as the name of your first born
(or already did!) AND we can call you 24/7 when our stack (i.e. your life’s
work) has the hiccups, we will love you forever and ever.

Your Interface with Nerdalize
-----------------------------
- Impact and responsibility from day 0. You’ll be building the foundation
of our stack.
- A high performance team where cutting edge technology is the name of the game.
If you know of something even newer and better, we love to hear it!
- No network bubble here. Together we are a full stack team and we're always
looking to understand what the rest of the team is doing.
- Weekly demo time to show the whole team what crazy stuff you’re working on.
In return you get a cold beer, meaningful feedback and some well
deserved praise.
- Champagne to celebrate success together, or a pep talk to help you learn from
your mistakes.
- Fun teammates for weird lunch discussions, team days, drinks,
parties, and more.
- A workplace at Europe’s biggest high-tech incubator: YES!Delft. The place is
buzzing with young, vibrant people with a passion for Friday drinks, foosball,
and working on great ideas to change the world (think: exoskeletons, rockets,
  bird repelling lasers etc. etc.).
